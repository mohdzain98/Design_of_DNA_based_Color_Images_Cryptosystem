## M.Tech Thesis Topic
DNA based color images refer to the encoding of the color images into DNA sequences called as DNA computing. 
DNA computing is a cutting-edge technology that harnesses the power of genetic material to perform complex computations. 
By encoding information into DNA strands, scientists can create vast amounts of data storage in a space smaller than a single grain of sand. 
The basic idea behind DNA computing is that DNA can be used to store and process information in a way that is similar to how a computer uses binary digits (bits) to represent data. 
Instead of representing images using traditional pixel values the image data is converted into a sequence of DNA nucleotides(Adenine-A, Thymine-T, Cytosine-C and Guanine-G). 
The process of converting color imagesâ€™s pixel values into a DNA sequence involve mapping the pixel value of a image to specific sequence of DNA bases. 
For each color channel i.e. RGB of pixel might be represented by a certain DNA bases or combination of bases. 
Overview of Conversion- The pixel value 0-255 can be converted into DNA sequence. Using a set of predefined rules we can map  0-63 to A, 64-127 to T, 128-191 to C and 192-255 to G.
